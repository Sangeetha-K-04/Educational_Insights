# 🎓 Cracking the Code: Educational Insights Dashboard 📊

> **"Where data meets education — uncovering patterns, problems, and progress in the world of online learning."**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project dives deep into global **online learning trends**, using a meticulously designed **Tableau dashboard** to reveal hidden patterns in enrollment, dropout rates, performance, and student behavior.  
From GPA trends to regional dropout analysis, this visualization tells the untold story of modern education powered by data.

🛠️ **Built with**:  
- 📈 **Tableau** (Dashboard & Visualization)  
- 📊 **Excel** (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing)  
- 🔍 **Self-curated educational dataset**

## 🧠 Key Insights Visualized

🔹 **🌍 Regional Drop Rate Analysis**  
Visualizes dropout rates across countries like Brazil, India, Mexico, and more. Identifies hotspots of concern and success.

🔹 **📅 Completion Dates & Attendance vs Age**  
Tracks how student age impacts performance over time using GPA, attendance, and completion year trends.

🔹 **🎯 Percentage Scores by Course Category**  
Analyzes top-performing fields like AI, Cybersecurity, and Data Science based on student scores.

🔹 **🎓 Grade Breakdown**  
Donut chart showing distribution across Distinction, First Class, and Second Class grades — instantly grasp overall performance.

🔹 **📆 Enrollment Timeline & Student Age Correlation**  
Explores how average student age has shifted across years and its impact on course attendance.

🔹 **📚 Course Duration vs GPA Over Time**  
Finds patterns between how long students take and how well they perform in fields like Machine Learning, Data Science, etc.

## 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ **Storytelling with Data**: Not just numbers — we tell a story about digital learning evolution.  
✅ **Global Perspective**: Real-world data analyzed across geographies and age groups.  
✅ **Clean, Professional Dashboard**: Intuitively designed, ideal for educational policy makers, ed-tech startups, and researchers.  
✅ **Interactive Visuals**: Dashboard allows slicing & dicing of data across dimensions.
